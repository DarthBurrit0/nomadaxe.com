[YAML Spec]

YAML spec seeks to provide a basic suite of tests for host-language independent
aspects of YAML.  In particular the aspects tested are:

  - comments
  - document start + end
  - basic ints, floats, booleans, nulls and strings
  - sequences (inline and block)
  - mappings (inline and block)
  - non-recursive anchors and aliases
  - string formatting modes

An implementation passing these tests would likely be suitable for parsing many
YAML files that don't use more advanced features such as user-defined tags,
recursive structures, etc.

[Test Format]

The tests (`spec.json`) are in JSON format to ensure cross-language compatability.
This is at the expense of expressability, hence only the above aspects of YAML
are exercised.

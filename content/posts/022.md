Tonight I teamed up with Jason and we got some more stuff in order. Originally we set up a server for Nomad Axe but it isn't really doing anything. So Jason is working on moving Nomad Axe from the server over to an Amazon S3 bucket. Anything dealing with player interaciotns can be handled in a different way using something called web RTC. More on this later as I wrap my head around it a little better.

I have been sitting on this favicon for a while so it's about time to throw it up on the site. I highly reccomend using [Icon Slate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icon-slate/id439697913?mt=12) for any of your icon needs. It allows your .ico to be retina ready with only one file and no code. You can check out this post on [daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/2013/01/retina_favicons) and it explains everything including how to use Slate Icon to make your favicon.

In addition I have been working on more of [Sam Lacanshires HTML5 game tutorials](http://html5gamedev.samlancashire.com/category/tutorials/). The [second tutorial](http://html5gamedev.samlancashire.com/making-a-simple-html5-canvas-game-part-2-adding-items/) adds 'items' to the canvas that the player can 'pick up,' [the third](http://html5gamedev.samlancashire.com/making-a-simple-html5-canvas-game-part-3-drawing-images/) allows you to add your own sprites, and [the fourth](http://html5gamedev.samlancashire.com/making-a-simple-html5-canvas-game-part-4-adding-a-counter/) adds a counter to the game. One thing I still don't understand is how to make the sprites loops. For example, if I wanted to add more frames to make it look like the character is walking. It's alright there is another tutorial that explains how do it and I will be going through it maybe sometime tomorrow.

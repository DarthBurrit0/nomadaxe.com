I know they are not pretty but here are my notes for Feb 4th. I have a bad habit of working on Nomad Axe for a couple hours at a time and then not imediately writing everything down in a super clear readable way...So I have decided instead of holding onto my notes and until I forget to do a write up and then just them sit in a folder forever...I will just post the short hand note I make during the process. If you are really interested you can always check out Nomad Axe on GitHub and see the exact changes made to the script.

* added a separate attack (now there is two attacks one for left hand and one for right hand)

* trying to help the game know when the character is facing a particular direction so attacks go the correct direction

* this link explains indexOF https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf

* drew a circle instead of a  square. this represents the area of attack.

Next up on the Nomad Axe chopping block:

* Weapon animations for right and left attacks
* Add walking animations
* Hooking up animations to attack
* Draw animations for bad guys
* Health system
* Hooking up .tmps from tiled
* Getting collision working so you can't walk through walls
* Design inventory system
* Design puzzle
* Multiplayer - the easy way

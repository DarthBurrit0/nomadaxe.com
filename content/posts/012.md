This week I have been working on learning more HTML. [Code Academy](http://www.codeacademy.com) is a solid resource and makes everything super accessible. I highly recommend it. I am trying to get through all of the HTML courses so I can go on to learn to JavaScript. 4 day streak! Considering JavaScript will be Axe's primary language the sooner I learn some basics the sooner I can help Mike and Jason with some of the more generic lifting as well as just over all comprehension of how my own game is going to work.

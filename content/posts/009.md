Github is still a little intimidating for me in terms of updating my changes to the project and pulling over changes made by others. Luckily I met with Jason today and we went through some of things that need to happen between now and my review in April.

In the first post on here I wrote about having some type of playable demo for the review. It's unlikely that will happen but it's okay. I am learning a lot and we have set down a lot of ground work for how things will be. A big part of this project is learning how to manage a project.

The bottom line is I need to be further ahead of them then I am. Knowing things in my head doesn't really help them so it's important that I generate more documents about details of the game and it how everything works - even if those things won't necessarily be in the prototype - even if they are things that we will never get to.

Another thing that is important for the project is how Nomad Axe is deployed to the web. Jason spent time working on that and I made a list of self assigned tickets to handle that will hopefully help Jason and Mike move forward as well.

Oh and I also made a sprite sheet with all the current character animations.

Looking at it now... it seems like we will be looking at Axes backside for the majority of the game...

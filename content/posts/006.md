title: Picking a Tile Unit Base

Thinking and reading about tile base grid system. A lot of games use a smaller tile base like 8x8 or 16x16 pixels. However I would like to be able to easily reiterate on my art and make it better as the games goes on. I really want an awesome handcrafted feel like in Link to the Past or Secret of Mana. If I want to go back and make the textures more detailed I only need to go back and modify the assets instead of worrying about having to make completely new assets that have to be scaled which could probably create problems down the road.

I want to use a grid base of 32x32. A grid base is important because it determines the collision in the game. A small grid base allows for more detailed collisions. By using a larger grid base I can have more detailed environment tiles. To keep my art simple for the prototype I will be scaling original 16x16 pixel art images up to 32 to keep the art consistent. When I am ready to add more details and reiterate on the art I will work at the actual size 32x32.

Mike and Jason were talking about how bad some websites look on retina displays due to assets not having a high enough resolution...since my game is more or a less website we came up with  a plan to help prevent Axe looking like garbage on new devices. Jason is going to work on a re-scaler to help with how the game will look on retina displays. We feel it would be a easy enough to scale all the images to twice their size so they don't look blurry on a retina screen.

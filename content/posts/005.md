Today was the second official meeting of the entire Nomad Axe team as it stands. Myself, Jason, Mike, and Omar. I am designing and working on the art for the game. Jason and Mike are coding the game and getting it to a point where it wont be entirely difficult for me to adjust different attributes in the game. Omar isn't necessarily contributing to the code or to art as of yet but he is genuinely interested in the process and has offered to help provide resources.   I plan to have him help me document the process a little further on. Specifically Omar is learning html and Javascript and wants practice building websites so I am going to have him help me with the blog/site where all of these updates are posted.

Today we split up various assignments and discussed how the workflow process will work using github. Essentially, I make tickets or issues and place all the details required for each assignment in the ticket. As we complete tasks and we can close tickets which brings us closer to our first milestone.

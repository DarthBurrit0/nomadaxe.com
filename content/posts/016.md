We held a team meeting on google meet-up to go over the notes and comments I received from my thesis review. I suggested a July deadline for the initial prototype and the general census is that the date seems practical. A majority of the thesis review notes were geared towards me, the presentation aspect of the game, and it's design documents so the frame work and technical aspects of Nomad Axe are kind of just business as usual. Two weeks according to Mike and Jason should be enough time to get something playable on the site. It won't be much but it should have the character and minimal animation.

title: It's Alive! - Canvas and Character

Some of the animations and Canvas are now working on the page. Axe (or the hero character if you prefer) moves around but his animations are a little wonky. He doesn't face the right direction as he moves up and down. As it turns out [iio Engine](http://iioengine.com/docs/iio-basics), the 2d rendering engine we picked out, isn't as well documented as it first appeared. That means there isn't a an ample amount of information for Mike and Jason to trouble shoot how the library works without plunking around for a bit. It's open source and it's free so I can't complain but we might need to switch things up later on. The getSprite function in the iio lib looks like this:

For now there is no background. There are assets we can use but I would rather just focus on getting the character movement right.

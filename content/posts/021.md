Wanted to add attack animations to the prototype but was having a hard time finding my way around the game.js file. So I revisited [this tutorial](http://html5gamedev.samlancashire.com/making-a-simple-html5-canvas-game-part-1-moving-a-sprite/) to kind of help me find my way around. This tutorial by Sam Lacanshire is incredibly simple to follow along and you can open it in your own browser as long as you put the html file and the game.js file in the same folder. I highly recomend this tutorial if you are just starting out. It really helped me close the gap on some of the concepts I was struggling with. Just in terms of the javascript checking for keys and deleting the information pressed keys leave behind. Of course Nomad Axe looks a bit different because IIO hasn't been removed yet. I can see in Axe's game.js file that each key press is being told to stop moving the hero when a key is released. Not exactly the info I was after but I certainly have a better feel of whats going on in there. That's all for today. I will probably go through and do te rest of Sam's tutorials. At least until we can get a new solution figured out to replace the IIO engine which is in the Nomad Axe Prototype now.

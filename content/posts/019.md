title: Animations Fixed, Grid Questions

Jason got the animations straightened out, well sort of. The hero now faces the correct direction but the animations start accelerating at some point and it begins to look like they are not moving at all. I guess it's sort of my fault for only using 2 frames for the prototype animations. In his broken state the hero seems to create a ice skating effect which brings me some joy. Being able to actually see the character I made move around on a screen with button inputs is super exciting. When I feel lost or like I hit a wall, I find myself opening up the website just to watch the little hero wander around and skate from one place to the next.

There is also a grid. Mike is working on path finding and the grid system which - once in place - will help the animations considerably. This is because the character will be moving to grid coordinates instead of relying on inputs. In either scenario we will need to iron out the animation. It looks jittery. In part because of how fast the animations are looping but mostly because there's only two frames for each simple action.

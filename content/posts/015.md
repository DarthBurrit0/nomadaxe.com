Today I presented the progress of Nomad Axe to my academic department's board of review. Last time I presented was back in December and it was more of a proposal for what I wanted to do. Now that the foundation of Axe has really started coming together in the past two weeks I have been feeling really good about the project but I was worried that the review board might not see much progress.

We have accomplished a lot but to someone who might not know any better there isn't much to actually look at. The Github repository is all set up, we have outlined a basic prototype, we have locked down an engine for rendering 2d animations, the Content Management System is just about ready, and the website where everything exists is now deployed. The board was pretty helpful and understanding of how things are coming together. Here are some of the notes they gave me:

* Focus on the PC version and don't worry about other devices like iOS.
* Use type font for notes on artwork and paper maps to make them look more professional.
* On map layouts document everything. Triggers, drops, enemies, puzzles, treasure, etc.
* Generate a purpose for the player in the prototype that is more than just the mechanics.
* Email progress in two weeks.

I think all of the notes make a lot of sense. However, there might be some misunderstanding about what a browser based game is in terms of them asking me to focus on the PC as a platform. I am designing the game around touch screen controls and the reason I decided on Nomad Axe as my thesis project was because of how much I despise touch controls for these types of games on iOS.

I want to create a fun game that has depth but can be played with one or two fingers. Sure, on the PC that control style maps to mouse events not touch events but they are similar enough that the transition should be pretty seamless. I understand that the board is concerned with the actual completion of the project and so with that mind set, focusing on one platform is actually fantastic advice. For me that platform is iPhone not PC. I think it's a lot easier to refine the design for a touch screen device and then move backwards to PC then to start with PC have a lot of controls and ample screen real estate and then try to cram all of that back into something like an iPhone. The first few years of iOS development provides a clear lesson. For example, all the major franchise ports that came out of EA and Ubisoft are just dust in the wind compared to something like Angry Birds. Eventually Epic caught on and they made Infinity Blade. Super successful and simple to use - they considered the platform instead of thinking about how games usually work and then forcing that onto a platform.

Of course we will be using key bindings for the early prototype controls at least until we get the path finding working. It is easier but it's a means to an end - not the way I want the game to actually feel upon completion.

The final note about emailing our progress in two weeks is interesting. Currently on the Nomad Axe website the play button just links to a picture of a bear. The board is looking for something playable even if it's totally broken. I will meet with the rest of the team on Sunday to see how realistic that goal is.

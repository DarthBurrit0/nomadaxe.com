title: Temporary Axe Sprite Sheet

Finished up this sprite sheet for the Hero character carrying an axe. I know its not the best way to do this. I have been looking at the source files for [Browser Quest](www.browserquest.com) and they make a separate sprite sheet layer for most the weapons and armor. This allows them to make things interchangeable. You can have a wooden sword and metal helmet per say. For now I figured it would be faster just to make the axe it's own sprite sheet since there won't be any other weapons in the initial prototype. Just trying to build all the basic pieces of the game so we can fit them together and figure out what how game will actually be.

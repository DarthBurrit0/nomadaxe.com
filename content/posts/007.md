title: Environment Rough For Prototype

I worked on creating a rough concept image for the Prototype. It's essentially just to help me wrap my head around what the initial area of the demo will look like and to help me quantify all the tile sets and props I will need to create that environment.

As I worked on this I thought it would probably be a goo idea to make my character slightly bigger than 1 grid unit (32x32px). The reason being it would be better for the character to interact and collide with the world on a more detailed level than 1 to 1. However there isn't really anything in the current plans for the game where that is super important but...I will probably need to plan around the idea of having the character be 64px tall instead of 32 in case I want to do interesting things with combat or the environment.

title: Cleaning Up a New Walk Animation
date: 2014-08-07

It's been a while since I have worked on Axe and even longer since I posted something about it. There's been a lot going on and sometimes it's hard to focus. Long story short, today is the first time I actually directly turned down payed work so I could just sit down and work on Axe for a little while. I had set up an all new walk animation and look for the hero character but for some reason the top half of the animation looked like it was animating backwards. I cleaned it up and kept it simple using only four frames. It's probably not the final look but it's a little closer than the previous stand in.

The other thing I worked on today was getting an actual header and generally a nicer look for the Dev Blog. I didn't get very far so more on that later.

I finished up the HTML section on [Code Academy](www.codeacademy.com) and started the Javascript one. I highly recommend checking that site out if you don't know anything about code. I didn't and now I do. The courses are broken up and it makes everything super accessible. There are extra assignments in the HTML section that I want to go back and complete, but I think the sooner I learn JavaScript the sooner I can wrapping my head around how Axe is going to work. I will continue to work on my HTML skills while simultaneously learning JavaScript.

I also adjusted some tiles and added a stone tile. Which ultimately doesn't matter for the prototype as nothing will have collision - initially. However, if we want to spruce it up we can. The cool thing is these tiles can be rotated and they will still work.

Here is Nomad Axe's current tile set:

Impressive.... I know.

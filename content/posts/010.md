Started messing around trying to make a cliff-rock sprite today. A concern I have had is that since my game takes place in a cave...is that everything is going to be brown. I am not going to worry to much about it now because I will be iterating on the art a lot later on. Just need to get some basic tiles together so I can flush out the environment a little better.

I think this one started to go in a direction I liked but it was only tile-able on two sides so I scraped it.

I still don't particularly care for the way this one came out but it will serve for now. It could use some much better antialiasing. I think I am trying too hard to adhere to general rules about shading by blending colors from one to the next - but pixel art demands a bigger picture perspective meaning focusing on details won't necessarily produce the correct result. Contrast is key. Grappling with this a lot: "There is a crack or an overlap here so I should shade this line of pixels but does it look like a crevasse or a crack when viewed in perspective of the overall game world / at appropriate viewing distance?"
